# Random stuff to the public, might be useful idk.
why are you here? it's just random stuff to the public. I mean it may be useful to some of y'all but it's just nonsense in the following.

# NTSC to PAL pitch and speed (roughly) - 7/10/24
Converting NTSC to PAL is shockingly **UN**complicated, but the semitone (pitch) upped is.. debatable to say the least. Some say is 0.42st or 0.50st. but i'll confirm this.
<br>
Doing a bit of research, NTSC uses 29.97fps while PAL uses 25fps. This results in faster video than audio if the audio was normal.
<br>
To match that faster video rate, typically converted, NTSC sped up by 1.0466% ===> PAL. This results in higher pitch and shortening the runtime of the film.
<br>
Pitch is up to roughly 0.74 semitones (by using a song, the Transpose chrome extension and ![this PAL Pitch Converter](https://sloxet.github.io/PAL-Pitch-Converter).)
<br>
440.0hz ==> 459.2hz
<br>
If you wanna speed up the BPM to PAL's speed without using the converter, you must add an exact amount of 6.354 bpm into your normal song BPM. And reverse, if you wanna slow down a PAL audio to the NTSC/Normal audio, you must apply a timestretch of 95.34%.
<br>
For example: 130bpm ==> 136.354bpm
<br>
This semitones and hertz will technically be like the PAL standard without speed.
<br>

Use this information or the converter if you wanna make a 2000's edit. Like Fruitiger Aero
