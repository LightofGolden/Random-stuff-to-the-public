# Random stuff to the public, might be useful idk.
why are you here? it's just random stuff to the public. I mean it may be useful to some of y'all but it's just nonsense in the following.

# NTSC to PAL pitch and speed (roughly) - 7/10/24
Converting NTSC to PAL is shockingly **UN**complicated, but the semitone (pitch) upped is.. debatable to say the least. Some say is 0.42st or 0.50st. but i'll confirm this.
<br>
NTSC sped up by 1.0466% ===> PAL
<br>
Pitch is up to roughly 0.74 semitones (by using a song, the Transpose chrome extension and ![this](https://sloxet.github.io/PAL-Pitch-Converter).)

440.0hz ==> 459.2hz
